            " In the previous video, we framed a few typical machine learning tasks or problems, things that we would like to solve with machine learning. In this video, we're going to take a look at a few scenarios or paradigms that could provide the solutions to those tasks. We can break down these learning scenarios into three primary categories. There are others, but for the most part, these three are the ones that are studied. So we have supervised learning, which is typically used for classification and regression type tasks. We have unsupervised learning, which is used for clustering type tasks. And reinforcement learning, as we said, is often posed as both solution space as well as the actual tasks themselves. There are, of course, different kinds of scenarios as well as other kinds of tasks, but we won't cover these for the duration of this course. In a supervised learning scenario, the learner is provided with labeled data. So if we were to draw this in a block diagram, we have our learning algorithm. We have inputs. So this is our raw input data. But we also have access to ground truth labels. So this ground truth could be generated automatically by the process by which you create this data. It could also be manually labeled by a human expert. So for example, when you set up your phone for voice recognition, perhaps it prompts you to say a specific word a few times, like, hey, Google. By doing this, the data set is generated with the input data or the raw audio signal, and the label is already provided because you have been prompted what to say. In this case, there was no need for an external expert to label the recorded sound after the fact. Often this is not really possible, and a human expert will have to go and manually label the data. For example, with self-driving vehicles, you might want to detect and track certain entities. You would need bounding boxes around pedestrians, other vehicles or road signs, which a human expert would have to be required to do. In this case, it would become very costly, especially for large data sets. Starting with the scenario, once we have our inputs, we can feed those into our learning algorithm, and that learning algorithm should produce some kind of output. In this output, we could compare with our ground truth. Once we've made that comparison, we can try to optimize our algorithm in order to produce outputs that are closer to what the labels say they should be. This lends itself to classification and regression tasks. For example, in classification, you could provide a picture of a dog as an input. The learning algorithm would produce some kind of output label. Maybe it says it's a cat. We would compare this to the ground truth, and that would tell you that something's gone wrong. You need to update your parameters. In an unsupervised learning scenario, the learner is provided with unlabeled data. So we have our learning algorithm. We have inputs. This time, we don't have access to any ground truth. So it's basically like doing a pass paper without having these solutions. algorithm can produce some output. But we don't really know if that is true or not. This doesn't mean that we can't learn anything. We could learn structure, so information about the data. We could learn what kind of inputs are similar, so that that's why this is suitable for clustering types of tasks. We could also learn something called dimensionality reduction. What this is really about is if we have an input with lots of dimensions, some of those variables might not be important to the task. But we could learn which of these is and is not important. We wouldn't really need an answer to that. And we'll see why this is the case in a future video. As mentioned before, we can tie the reinforcement learning problem to a reinforcement learning scenario. In this scenario, a learning agent can observe and interact with an environment. So we have some environment. And we have what we call an agent. Where agents are entities that can sense and act on an environment. So when we sense our environment, we can get an idea of the state. So that is both the state of the environment, as well as the state of the agent. And it can also act on that environment. And this is important because it differentiates it from other types of machine learning scenarios. So in supervised and unsupervised learning, we don't influence the environment during our data collection process. So here the agent can interact. So if we move the robot, the kinds of data that it's collecting changes as it performs these actions. And lastly, what we need to complete the reinforcement learning scenario is some kind of reward. So depending on how well our actions allow our agent to accomplish a given task, that will dictate the kind of reward it receives. It does not receive instructions for every state. We don't specify what action the agent should take. This action has to be learned. The only way that the agent gets feedback is through this reward system. In the next video, we take a look at the other components that allow our algorithms to learn.\n"
