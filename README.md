### What is a micro-mouse? 
A micromouse is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve a maize as quickly as possible. More abstractly, a micromouse is a maze-solving robot or an autonomous maze navigator. To gain context of what a micromouse is, watch [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQbHMgK2rw) video.

### Project Overview
This project is all about designing some subassemblies for a (simplified) micro-mouse. The (simplified) micromouse has four modules, namely: the processor, motherboard, sensing and power. This project is solely focused on creating the power and sensing subsystems that will collaborate with the rest of the micro-mouse's other subsystems (that have already been designed). 

## Exposition of each module-

- **The motherboard**
- **The processor**
- **The power**
- **The sensor**
