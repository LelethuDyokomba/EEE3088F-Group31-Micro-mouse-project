# EEE3088F-Group31-Micro-mouse-project

A micromouse is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve a maize as quickly as possible. More abstractly, a micromouse is a maze-solving robot or an autonomous maze navigator.
This project is all about designing some subassemblies for a (simplified) micro-mouse. Particularly, it entails designing and manufacturing the sensor and power modules/subsystems.
