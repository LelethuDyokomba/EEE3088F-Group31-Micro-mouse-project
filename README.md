### Project Overview
This project is all about designing some subassemblies for a (simplified) micro-mouse. Particularly, it entails designing and manufacturing the sensor and power subsystems that will collaborate with the rest of the micro-mouse's other subsystems (that have already been designed).

The (simplified) micromouse has four modules, namely: the processor, motherboard, sensing and power. This project is solely focused on creating the power and sensing subsystems. 

### What is a micro-mouse? 
A micromouse is an autonomous robot designed to navigate and solve a maize as quickly as possible. More abstractly, a micromouse is a maze-solving robot or an autonomous maze navigator.
